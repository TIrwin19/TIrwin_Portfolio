            Hi, my name is Trevor and I am an aspiring fullstack developer. I love problem solving and technology which
            makes fullstack web development a perfect fit. Often, in my spare time, I can be found at my computer just
            playing with code or researching to learn something new. I see so many apps and websites lack a solid easy
            to use, well designed, user interface and I want to change that.
